# Personal Website Client v3

## I recently decommissioned this client in favor of a new site that is simpler and easier to expand upon.
This is the frontend component of my personal website which uses Next.js as both a frontend and backend-for-frontend.

[See the repo for the new website here!](https://github.com/tdep/trevordepew.com)
[Or, heckout my website here!](https://www.trevordepew.com/portfolio)

### Tools:
- Next.js
- React
- Typescript
- Heroku

### Why did I build this?
After graduating from bootcamp in Feb. of 2023, I built a portfolio website in order to take all that I learned and combine it into a single application that could feature all of the projects I had built and demonstrate the skills I had at the time. That site was great, but it was basically just a frontend application with a heavy emphasis on CSS (which was the goal). Nothing wrong there, especially for a portfolio, but I wanted to integrate the new skills I had gained from my time in the Spotify Technical Fellowship and the decision to rebuild my website was born. This time, however, I built a [backend API and database](https://github.com/tdep/tdep-tadlab-api) to serve as the basis of my new website. I also decided that this new website was not only going to feature my portfolio, but would be the basis for many of the little projects I've built and want to rebuild (like software synthesizers!).

### Why use Next.js and Typescript?
My former manager at Spotify introduced me to Next.js and Typescript which I grew very fond of. My primary focus was in backend development and Java, so I found an appreciation for typed languages (it feels more orderly) and decided to build this project using those.

### Future plans:
- [ ] The next step will be to optimize for mobile devices.
- [ ] Add login / admin abilities.
- [ ] Add a dashboard for editing the information displayed on the site (as an admin).
- [ ] Create a blog page.
- [ ] Add other modules / apps to the site as I build and rebuild other projects.

### Special thanks:
@ashkan18 for teaching me about Next.js and Typscript, and BFFs!

### From Next.js:
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Getting Started:

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
